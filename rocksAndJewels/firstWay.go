// Rocks and jewels
// You have two lines of lowercase Latin characters: line J and line S.
// The characters in the line J are "jewels", in line S are "stones".
// You need to determine how many "stones" are "jewels" at the same time.
// Put simply, you need to check how many characters from S are also in J.
// This is a warm-up task which have ready-made solutions.
// It is very simple and is necessary to get comfortable with Yandex.Contest.
// Input and output can be done through Ô¨Åles, or through standard I/O streams, as you prefer.
